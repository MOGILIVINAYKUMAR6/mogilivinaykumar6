    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello there! I'm Mogili Vinay Kumar, and now a little about me</p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I'm a graduate student at Kent state University. I enjoy reading News paper, reading bookd of fictional kind, and I'm passionate about computer science.</p>
    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p> In July 2015, I enrolled in a 6-year Integrated Bachelor of Technology in Electrical and
        Electronics Engineering, Rajiv Gandhi University of Knowledge Technologies-BASAR, which
        allowed me to gain hands-on experience and practical knowledge on few courses namely
        Microprocessors and Microcontrollers, Electronic Circuits, Power Electronics, Linear Control
        Systems Engineering, Power Systems, Network Theory under the graduation program of which
        the last two are my favorite.</p>
    <h4>Work Experience</h4>
    <p> In March 2020, I joined Tata Consultancy Services as System Engineer, working in a
        functional testing team. In this position, I am entrusted to look after the testing phase of the
        software development process to ensure the final product meets the organization's quality
        standards. Here, I got an opportunity to constantly engage with clients to understand their
        requirements and thereby assist the team in achieving the desired outcome. Since it was my first
        full-time position, initially, I faced certain challenges, as starting a career in a fast-paced
        organization like ours with short sprints is quite challenging. But I quickly adapted, and through
        teamwork, and learned the required skills for which I received appreciation from my peers and
        mentors. All these experiences have crafted me as a better individual with a lot of enlivening
        spirit to realize my dreams and develop a well-rounded personality.</p>
    <h5> Co-Curricular Activities </h5>
    <p> With a zeal to develop my overall personality, I ensured to participate in co-curricular activities
        right from my school years. I hold the prestigious National Cadet Corps 'A' Grade Certificate. I
        learnt unity, discipline, leadership, and teamwork by being a part of NCC. During under
        graduation, with my leadership skills, I was elected to be a founding member of Student
        Governing Council, RGUKT-Basar, through these I strengthened the council by organizing
        various counselling programs on prevention of Ragging and Eve-Teasing for the well-being of
        the student's community. </p>
